Issues/Challenges
1. Installing/Setting-Up software&repository
	*Travis-CI
	*PostgreSQL
	*GitHub
	*Docker (Desktop)
		-virtualization issue
			#RESOLVED: Enabled virtualization from BIOS and Windows features
		-WSL2 kernel update not installed issue
			#RESOLVED: Installed the Linux kernel update package from 
			https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package.
	*MySQL
	*VS Code

2. Docker containers
	*Setting up and building Docker containers for each database and application
		-Setting up the Dockerfile
			#Creating working directory
			#Copying python script files to be accessed in the container
			#Installing python packages so that the python script files have access to them in the containers
		-Setting up the Docker-Compose file
			#Creating all three containers for salesdb database, dw database, and python application
			#Port mappings for the database connections
			#Ensuring python application depends on the database containers running
			#Ensuring python application container remains running after being built
		-Running cmd commands to build Docker images
		-Running cmd commands to create and run the Docker containers
		
3. Python script files in Docker containers
	*Testing and verifying the python scripts can access database containers
		-Running cmd commands (docker exec) to run the python script files
			#Originally used PowerShell but had issues with syntax (RESOLVED: used cmd instead)
		-Within the python scripts, application has to be able to connect to/access the MySQL database containers
			#Eventually figured out that "host" names had to be the service name used from the docker-compose.yml file
			#Authentication plugin (used mysql_native_password, this is not the default)

4. Python application to connect to API and write to databases
	*Installing and using helper libraries
		-Saw the Documentation page and found python package for swapi to help with the application
	*Logic to retrieve data from API, transform the data, and store as variable in python application
	*Logic to loop through a list of objects to obtain all necessary data
	*Logic to insert the data into the databases by using the stored variables
	*Logic to use value from one poster type to obtain value(s) of another poster type
		-Using starships to obtain respective film titles and release date
